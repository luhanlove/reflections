When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    当我和其它人共同创建某个项目时，当本地空间不够时。
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    手动拉取和推送更加灵活。自动同步版本没有手动拉取多次提交有效。
    而且用户可能会再度进行更改，自动同步版本可能会会错用户的意思。

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork：Github在服务器上对于代码的复制。
    clone：可以是本地对远程的复制，也可以是本地对本地的复制。
    branch：当我需要离开主线做一些其它事时，我们需要做分支。
